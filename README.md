# CashEase — eWallet Landing Page

CashEase is a modern, responsive landing page template for an eWallet product. This project was built as a design-to-code implementation, with an emphasis on layout precision, consistent spacing/typography, and smooth UI interactions using **vanilla front-end technologies**.

**Live Demo:** YOUR_LIVE_DEMO_LINK  
**Repository:** YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_LINK

## Overview

CashEase was created to replicate a real fintech marketing experience—clean, fast, and trustworthy. The goal was to go beyond a static page by adding practical interactive components (slider + accordion) while keeping the codebase lightweight and easy to customize. The UI is fully responsive and organized with reusable class naming (`ce-*`) for maintainability.
